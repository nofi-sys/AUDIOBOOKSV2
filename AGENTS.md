# AGENTS instructions

This file coordinates sequential work on the Check_Audiobook project. Each agent should read the tasks below before starting and update the status after completing their assignment. Work sequentially to avoid merge conflicts.

## Guidelines
- Work on the `main` branch only. Pull the latest commits before starting a task.
- After finishing a task, update this file marking the task status as `done`.
- Run `flake8` and `pytest` before committing.
- Keep commits focused on one task at a time.
